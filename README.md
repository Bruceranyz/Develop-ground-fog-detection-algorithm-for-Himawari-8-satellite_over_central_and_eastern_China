# Development of a ground fog detection algorithm for Himawari-8 satellite over central and eastern China

## A brief description of this project
This study aims to provide a feasible terrestrial fog detection algorithm in central and eastern China from a satellite perspective. Next, I will introduce the practical significance and progress of this research, so as to provide a background knowledge for people who want to know this issue, even though they have never covered this topic before. I will follow the introduction, data and methods, results and discussion to develop this work. Beisdes, the corresponding data and code of data preprocessing, methodology and results visualization are available, so that interested researchers can more easily understand the progress of this work. I also welcome anyone who are interested to join me in completing the meaningful work.

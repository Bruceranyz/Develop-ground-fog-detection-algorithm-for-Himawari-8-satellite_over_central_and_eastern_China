# Develop_ground_fog_detection-algorithm-for-Himawari-8-satellite_over_central_and_eastern_China

## A brief description of this project
This study aims to provide a feasible terrestrial fog detection algorithm in central and eastern China from a satellite perspective. Next, I will gradually introduce the practical significance and progress of this research in this project to provide a background knowledge for people who want to know this issue, even though they have never covered this topic before. I will follow the introduction, data and methods, results and discussion to develop this work. Beisdes, the corresponding data and data preprocessing, methodology and results visualization code are available, so that interested researchers can more easily understand the progress of this work. We also welcome people who are interested to join us in completing this meaningful work.
